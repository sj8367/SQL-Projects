#**SQL-Project-on-Olympics-History**#

#***Project Overview***#
This project involved an in-depth analysis of Olympic data spanning 120 years, from 1896 to 2016, to uncover key insights and trends. Utilizing two comprehensive datasets, the analysis aimed to provide a detailed understanding of athlete performances, team achievements, and historical milestones in the Olympics.

#***Datasets***#
1. Athlete Dataset: This dataset contains information about the athletes, including their attributes and the teams they represent.
2. Event Dataset: This dataset includes details about various events, the seasons in which they took place, and the athletes who participated and won medals for their teams.

#***Key Insights Generated***#
By leveraging SQL queries, the following insights were extracted:

1. The team that has won the maximum gold medals over the years.

2. For each team print total silver medals and year in which they won maximum silver medal..output 3 columns team,total_silver_medals, year_of_max_silver

3. The player that has won maximum gold medals amongst the players who have won only gold medal (never won silver or bronze) over the years

4. In each year which player has won maximum gold medal . Write a query to print year,player name and no of golds won in that year . In case of a tie print comma separated player names.

5. The event and year in which India has won its first gold medal,first silver medal and first bronze medal, print 3 columns medal,year,sport

6. Players who won gold medal in summer and winter olympics both.

7. Players who won gold, silver and bronze medal in a single olympics. print player name along with year.

8. Players who have won gold medals in consecutive 3 summer olympics in the same event . Consider only olympics 2000 onwards. Assume summer olympics happens every 4 year starting 2000. print player name and event name.

#***Technologies Used***#
- **Database Management System**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Skills Utilized**: SQL querying, data analysis.

#***Conclusion***#
This project demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets, perform complex data analyses, and generate meaningful insights through SQL queries, showcasing my expertise in database management and data analytics.
